# Sales Forecasting Project 

## Overview
This project focuses on sales forecasting using historical data from a retail company. The goal is to analyze the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), handle outliers and poor data quality, and develop forecasting models to predict sales for June 2021.

## Data Set
The dataset contains information about products, manufacturers, area codes, sourcing channels, product sizes, product types, months of sourcing, and sourcing costs. It spans from June 2020 to May 2021 for the training set, and June 2021 for the test set.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process involves:
- Checking for missing values and handling them appropriately.
- Visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends in the data using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- Identifying outliers and applying strategies like winsorization and data transformations to handle them.

## Handling Outliers and Poor Data Quality
For handling outliers and poor data quality:
- Outliers are detected using statistical methods and visual inspection.
- Strategies like winsorization, log transformations, and imputation are applied to address outliers and improve data quality.

## Forecasting Approaches
Several approaches are considered for forecasting the June 2021 test set:
1. Time series analysis using ARIMA or SARIMA models.
2. Machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or LSTM networks.
3. Ensemble methods combining multiple forecasting models.

## Comparison of Approaches
In the notebook, different forecasting approaches are implemented and compared:
- ARIMA model: Utilizes historical sales data and seasonal patterns to forecast future sales.
- Random Forest model: Learns from various features such as product type, manufacturer, and sourcing channel to predict sales.
- Ensemble model: Combines predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness.

## Final Approach
The final approach involves using an ensemble model consisting of ARIMA and Random Forest models:
- ARIMA captures time series patterns and seasonality.
- Random Forest incorporates additional features and non-linear relationships for more accurate predictions.
- Ensemble combines the strengths of both models to achieve a balanced and reliable sales forecast for June 2021.

## Conclusion
By leveraging Python and its libraries for data analysis, EDA, outlier handling, and forecasting, this project aims to provide valuable insights and accurate predictions to support business decision-making in the retail industry.
